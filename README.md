## How 42sh Works

When a command is entered into 42sh, it undergoes several stages of processing:

**Lexical Analysis**: Initially, the shell performs a lexical analysis on the input. This phase involves converting a sequence of characters into meaningful sequences, known as lexemes. During this process, 42sh reads the stream of characters that make up the command, grouping them into lexemes. For each lexeme, 42sh generates a token in the form of (token-name, attribute-value), which is then passed on to the next phaseâ€”syntactic analysis.

**Syntactic Analysis**: The subsequent phase is syntactic analysis, also referred to as parsing. In this stage, 42sh utilizes the tokens produced by the lexical analysis to construct a tree-like intermediate representation that illustrates the grammatical structure of the command. This representation is typically an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), where each interior node signifies an operation, and the node's children represent the operation's arguments.

**Execution**: Once the command has been parsed into an AST, 42sh functions as an interpreter to execute the command. An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without the need for these instructions to have been previously compiled into a machine language program. In this context, 42sh interprets the AST and executes the command as per the interpretation.

## Features

This README provides an overview of the various capabilities of 42sh, including:

- [Shell variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Variables.html) monitoring
- [Job control](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Job-Control-Basics.html)
- History management
- Alias management
- [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) interaction
- Built-in test operators

42sh is built on top of Mike's and Jakke's [21sh](https://github.com/mike-ninja/21sh), with each member of the group responsible for one modular part and fulfilling mandatory requirements. This collaboration has resulted in a reliable shell interpreter that caters to the needs of both novice and experienced users.

## Monitoring of Shell Variables

42sh offers complete monitoring of shell variables, allowing users to:

- Create and export internal variables to the environment using the built-in `export` command.
  ```bash
  export VAR_NAME="Hello, World!"
  echo $VAR_NAME # Outputs: Hello, World!
  ```
- List all shell internal variables with the `set` command, without any additional options required.
  ```bash
  set # Lists all shell internal variables.
  ```
- Revoke internal and environment variables with the `unset` command.
  ```bash
  unset VAR_NAME
  echo $VAR_NAME # Outputs nothing as VAR_NAME is unset.
  ```

42sh also supports environment variable creation for unique commands, such as `HOME=/tmp cd`, enhancing shell environment management.

## Job Control and Signal Monitoring

42sh provides job control monitoring with built-ins `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, and the `&` operator. The shell interpreter also correctly monitors all signals, ensuring a smooth user experience.
```bash
sleep 100 & # Starts a job in the background.
jobs # Lists the jobs.
```
## History Management

42sh features complete history management capabilities, allowing users to:

- Access their command history and perform expansions using `!!`, `!word`, `!number`, and `!-number` syntax.
  ```bash
  echo hello # Outputs: hello
  !! # Outputs: hello
  ```
- Save command history to a file for usage over multiple sessions.
- Perform incremental search in the history with `CTRL-R`.

The built-in `fc` command supports all POSIX options.

## Alias Management and Hash Table Interaction

42sh provides easy alias management with built-ins `alias` and `unalias`, simplifying the process of creating and removing aliases. Furthermore, 42sh provides a hash table and built-in `hash` to interact with it, facilitating the management of frequently used commands.
```bash
alias ll="ls -lah" # Creates an alias 'll' for the command 'ls -lah'.
ll # Executes 'ls -lah'.
```
## Check File Types and Compare Values

42sh includes a built-in `test` with a comprehensive set of operators, facilitating file type checks and value comparisons.

## Inhibitors

42sh provides complete handling of inhibitors, including `"` (double quote), `'` (simple quote) and `\`, ensuring that users can execute commands with confidence.
```bash
echo "This is a \"quoted\" word." # Outputs: This is a "quoted" word.
```
## Conclusion
42sh is a powerful tool with a comprehensive set of features that allow users to execute commands and manage their shell environment effortlessly. Whether you're a seasoned user or new to the shell environment, 42sh offers a seamless and efficient user experience.
