aggregation + pipe combo breaks up, did not test closefd yeasdf && echo hello || echo pallo | w

TEST CLOSEFD REDIR AGGRE WITH PIPES
Fileaggregation works with >&3 and >&4, it should not. If we close those, something else breaks also in stdin for example

$> ls 56>&1 >&56
42sh: syntax error near unexpected token: `>'

Currently stops with ls 56>file without error or seg????? 
Is the segfaulthandler the reason?? Stop happens in exe_open_fd_if_needed.c:close_previously_closed

Test all kind of redir aggre and closefd with aliased and alias fd's
also use 255 and over

ls 56>&1> Incorrect output

< file cat //breaks stdin
base64 | head -c 5 //Hangs because of endless output from base64
